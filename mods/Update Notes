[Update Notes]
-Added update notes so I can look back at each update

[Release 1]
-|Wacky Armor Mods| Combined Earplugs, Silly Sounds, and Thwomper Stopmpers mods into one, made each item need the player to level up the "Armor Crafting" skill mostly to balence the items and not completely making vehicles oboslete, also made each item have different recipes and longer to make.
-|Paper Gathering| Added 3 new recipes
-|Mineral Selling| Updated game version
-|Glass Maker| Fix small bug and updated game version
-|Bring Jars Back| Changed icon to [XxMasonBoyxX](https://7daystodiemods.com/updated-empty-jar-icon-no-model/) version keeping a link as a support
-|Dye Making| Combined my dye making and my alternate into one also changed one of them(forgot how I did it) to chemestry and campfire now you can make dyes in thes two with campfire being 35 paint and the Chemistry Station being 15.
-|Custome Recipes| Added 6 new recipes 3 are custom items I made just for recipies for existing items for instance Acid, Crucible, and Beaker was going to make one for ballistic fiber but it got removed from the game. 

E.N. Thinking of adding Ballistic Fiber back for new recipes as well as making that reccipe for Thwomper Stompers or other OP items
