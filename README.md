- This mod adds several new survivor tech toys: the Thwomp Stompers from the Mario movie, letting you jump higher and launch further; the Long Fall Boots from Aperture Science, which completely negate fall damage; the Earplugs, which reduce all volume when equipped; and the Clown Horn, which swaps serious sounds for goofy honks and squeaks. Activate them like any other toggle mod (Flashlight, Night Vision, etc.) and enjoy.
